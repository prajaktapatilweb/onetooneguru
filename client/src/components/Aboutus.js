                                        <h4 className=" text-justify "> The ratio of the number of students to teachers is often used to adjudge the quality of the teaching-learning process. Research indicates that the smaller this ratio, the better is the learning. But even in the best institutions, there are crowded classrooms in which one teacher is teaching several dozen students, sometimes even hundreds of students! How can any teacher, however good, provide personalised attention to each student in such a large class? To overcome this, with the support of state-of-art technology, we have designed an individual digital classroom for each student: One Guru One Shishya (One Mentor One student) </h4>
